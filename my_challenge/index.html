    <h1>Section 7: Get Ready for the Future: ES6 / ES2015</h1>
    <h2>CODING CHALLENGE</h2>
    <p>
        Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1. Parks
        </li>
        <li>
            2. Streets
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and
        a build year.
    </p>
    <p>
        At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1. Tree density of each park in the town (forumla: number of trees/park area)
        </li>
        <li>
            2. Average age of each town's park (forumla: sum of all ages/number of parks)
        </li>
        <li>
            3. The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees
        </li>
        <li>
            4. Total and average length of the town's streets
        </li>
        <li>
            5. Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is unknown, the default is
            normal
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All the report data should be printed to the console.
    </p>
